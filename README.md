# D7018E-Assignment3
This program decodes an array of decrypted chars (defined in the program) and prints them to the terminal.
Compile using rustc (tested using 1.23.0-nightly) or cargo and run it in the terminal. 
In this version the original data, the decrypted data and the decryption seed are allocated on the heap using static.
